# Password Generator 

## Description

- I coded this password generator for a company that holds important/sensitive data. They needed to be able to create a strong, randomized password to provide greater security for their employees. 
- By creating the password randomizer, I was able to create extremely secure passwords using specified criteria that is decided by the employee's discretion. The problem was figuring out how to allow them to select the criteria they wanted, while also implementing the choice of length for their password.
- By doing this, I learned how to use "for loops" to look for answers and push those to a specific variable; how to use "while loops" to set paramiters on the length of the password; how to push variable's contents into empty ones using "switch casing".
